# 🤝 Code of Conduct

## 📝 Personal Note

This is my personal learning project where I'm porting an existing codebase to learn and improve my skills. While I'm working on this independently, I welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping out or learning alongside me.

## 🌈 Community Standards

### ✅ Things I appreciate:
* 😊 Being kind and respectful to each other
* 🧠 Sharing knowledge and suggestions
* 💬 Giving constructive feedback
* 🙏 Being patient as I'm still learning
* 🔍 Focusing on solutions, not problems

### ❌ Things to avoid:
* 🚫 Harassment or offensive comments
* 👎 Personal attacks
* 🔁 Spamming or trolling
* 🔒 Sharing personal information
* 😞 Any behavior that would make others feel unwelcome

## 💻 Code Quality Guidelines

Since this is my learning journey, code quality is important to me:

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 📝 **TypeScript** | I'm trying to use proper TypeScript types (avoiding `any` when possible) |
| 📚 **Comments** | I add comments for complex functions to help myself and others understand the code |
| 🧩 **Patterns** | I'm following the patterns of the original codebase I'm porting |
| 🧪 **Testing** | I'm learning about testing as I go |
| 📈 **Improvement** | I welcome feedback that helps me improve |

## ⚠️ If Problems Arise

If you have any issues or concerns while contributing to this project, please reach out to me directly. This is a personal learning experience, and I want to keep it positive and productive for everyone involved.
